numworks on switch?

this is the site: https://wariomastergg.github.io/Numworks-web-switch/

but its the web simulator

cool!

im still working on it though

also i got the idea from: https://github.com/RealDekkia/switch-tetris

To acces it on the Console I reccomend you to use the "switchbru" DNS-Server: http://switchbru.com/dns

stuff i used:
